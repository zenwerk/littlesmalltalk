        creator is a pointer to the interpreter which created
        the current interpreter.  it is zero except in the case
        of blocks, in which case it points to the creating
        interpreter for a block.  it is NOT a reference, ie,
        the ref_count field of the creator is not incremented when
        this field is set - this avoids memory reference loops.

        stacktop is a pointer to a pointer to an object, however it
        is not considered a reference.   ie, changing stacktop does
        not alter reference counts.
