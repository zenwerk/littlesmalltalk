    for strings s_size = STRINGSIZE

    Unlike other special objects (integers, floats, etc), strings
    must keep their own super_obj pointer, since the class
    ArrayedCollection (a super class of String) contains instance
    variables, and thus each instance of String must have a unique
    super_obj.
