    environmental factors

    This include file gathers together environmental factors that
    are likely to change from one C compiler to another, or from
    one system to another.  Please refer to the installation
    notes for more information.

    for systems using the Make utility, the system name is set
    by the make script.
    other systems (such as the Mac) should put a define statement
    at the beginning of the file, as shown below
